We tried to give our website some common functionality such as Carousel Sliding, Tab Switching, Hover Effects, mouse Effect, StoreBrand pages, product pages, cart pages, and product description pages. checkout page, Payment page, and order Confirmation page



We had a time frame of six days. This was the second website building project for all of us, yes am emphasizing “website building” because we have built this website from scratch.




We have tried to build the exact homepage, product page, cart page, checkout page, Payment page, and order confirmation page with the tab switch and the on-hover, and many other functions. We have built the exact footer as it is on the original website.
